 To use React.js in your Course Compass project, you'll need to install it in your development environment.
- **Node.js**: Firstly you will need a development environment, for that we will use Node.js. The installation method for which is listed below:-
    1. Install Node.js by<br>
        `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash` <br>

- **React.js**: Now we will have to install react.js library, by doing the following commands:-
    1. Verify that Node.js is installed correctly by running the following command,<br>
        `node --version`<br>
    2. Create a new directory and change into it, for example,<br>

    4. Install React.js and its dependencies by running the following command,<br>
        `npm install react react-dom`<br>
    5. To start the development server, run the following command,<br>
        `npm start` <br>

- **React App**: Now we will need to create a react app for which we need to do:-
    1. Choose a directory.
    2. Run the following command to create a new React app,<br>
        `npx create-react-app my-react-app`<br>
    3. Once the command has finished running, navigate into your new React app directory.
    4. You can now start the development server by running the following command,<br>
        `npm start`<br>

- **Tailwind CSS**: 
    1. Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies by running the following command,<br>
        `npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`<br>
    2. Generate a default tailwind.config.js file by running the following command,<br>
        `npx tailwindcss init`<br>
    3. Create a postcss.config.js file in your project directory and add the following code to it,<br>
        ```javascript
        module.exports = {
            plugins: [
                require('tailwindcss'),
                require('autoprefixer'),
            ]
        }
        ``` 
        <br>
    4. Create a src/css/styles.css file in your project directory and add the following code to it,<br>
        ```css
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```
        <br>
    5. In your project's package.json file, add the following scripts,<br>
        ```json
        "scripts": {
            "build": "postcss src/css/styles.css -o public/css/styles.css",
            "watch": "postcss src/css/styles.css -o public/css/styles.css --watch"
        }
        ```
        <br>
    6. Create a public directory in your project directory and create an index.html file in it.
    7. Add a link to your CSS file in the head section of your index.html file,<br>
        `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">`<br>
    8. Start the development server by running the following command,<br>
        `npm run watch`<br>

### Run the Code
To finally run the website, you just have to follow these few commands:
1. Navigate into your React app directory and make sure that all the necessary dependencies are installed by running the following command,<br>
    `npm install`<br>
2. To compile your React app, run the following command,<br>
    `npm run build`<br>
3. To run your React app, you can use a server like serve or http-server. To install serve, run the following command,<br>
    `npm install -g serve`<br>
4. Once serve is installed, you can start the server and serve your React app by running the following command,<br>
    `serve -s build`<br>
This should start the server and serve your React app on port 5000. <br>
That's it! You have now successfully compiled and run your React app. :star_struck:
